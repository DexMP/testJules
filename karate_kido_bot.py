Karate Kido Bot

Description:
A bot to automate playing Telegram games like Karate Kido 2 using screen capture
and keyboard emulation.

Dependencies:
- mss
- opencv-python
- numpy
- pyautogui

Installation:
Install dependencies using: pip install mss opencv-python numpy pyautogui

Basic Usage:
1. Ensure the Telegram game is open and visible on your primary screen.
2. Adjust the `GAME_ROI` dictionary in this script to define the game area
   boundaries (top, left, width, height). This is a crucial step.
3. Run the script: python karate_kido_bot.py
4. The bot will display the captured game area. Press 'q' in the display
   window to quit the bot.

Note:
Currently, detection and decision logic are placeholders. Actual game
interaction (key presses via pyautogui) is commented out by default in the
`perform_action` function.
